### Plan

1. **Review the starter code**. In this project, we focus on the `script.js` file.
2. **Build the products**. Test and confirm all aspects of the user interface are working. Fix the code as needed.
3. **Create the cart functionality**. Test and confirm all aspects of the user interface are working. Fix the code as needed.
4. **Create the checkout functionality**. Test and confirm all aspects of the user interface are working. Fix the code as needed.
5. **Refactor your code** to improve its appearance and functionality.
6. **Test before submission**. You should be testing as you build, but it's always good to do one more set of tests before you submit the project.
